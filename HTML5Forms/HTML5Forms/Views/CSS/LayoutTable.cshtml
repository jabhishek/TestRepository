            There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500
varieties of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of
apples, oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced with
thousands of choices.

            One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available
in each country. I live near London, in an area which is known for
its apples.

            When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many different kinds of
banana were available - many of which had unique flavours and which
were only avaiable within a small region.
